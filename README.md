### Description ###

"CreatePhotoShow" is a macOS application meant to assist in creating
photo shows.

It will first take a chosen folder, identify all JPEG images therein
whose names begin with two or three letters followed by a space, dot,
or dash, and classify those images into groups according to those two
or three letters.

It will then prompt the user to choose a number _n_, create a
subfolder _n_`per-Display`, and populate it with symbolic links to the
first _n_ images (taken in alphabetical filename order) from each of
the image groups abovementioned.
